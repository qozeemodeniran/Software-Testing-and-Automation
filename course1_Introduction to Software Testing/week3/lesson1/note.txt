---Testing in the Software Development Lifecycle---

--Lesson1--
Fundamental testing Process
What is Testing Plan? -  document describing scope, approach, resources and schedule of intended testing activities.

Components of a test Plan
* Testing approach/strategy
* Scope
* Schedule 
* Resources/Test environment
* Entry and Exit criteria
* Requirements matrix (for traceability)
* What is NOT tested
* Test cases and scripts [separate document(s)]

Test plan activities
- use test plan template or design on
- list what cannot be tested
- write only what is needed
- review the test plan
- make it a 'living' document


---Importance of a good test plan---

why we need good test plan
- organize, shcedule, and manage testing effort
- helps in writing test cases
- improves communiation between devs and management.
- measuring software quality is the intent
- developing good test sets takes planning
- knowing when to stop
- more effective arguments when you have facts. 

Test planning is important
- creating a plan and sticking to it makes it easier
- ensure everything is completed
- know when to stop
- have facts to bolster arguments
- say NO to project release is you have to

Stages fo Software Testing Process
1. Unit test: done by developers. it's a whiteboard testing at its core. it involves testing for loop boundaries for off-by errors, excercising arrays and their bounds.
--Unit Test Plan: 

2. Design Ver. testing - 
    * Integration test - done by devs. makes sure every module that's been unit-tested works well together.
    * Functional test - done by test-group. involves debugging test casees at the same time final design is being implemented. It is the largest segment og testing.

3. System Vel. testing - test area test done once the full system is completed.
    * System test - testing with expected behavior
    * non-functional test - quality with which behavior is delivered(e.g usability, security, performance, protability, scalability etc)
    * Test report

4. Customer Acceptance testing - written by test-group with CX input but ofter performed by few personalities.

Test Status Report
- what you send during the testing process.
--How the test cycle is going
--occurs after each testing cycle

Test Report
- How entire testing effort went for a project
- occurs at the end of testing

Test (Status) resport Contents
- evaluate how testin went/is going
- list what is tested
- list what's not tested, and why
- list stil-open defects
- show actual schedule
- tell developers what works/doesn't

Reasons for test (status) report
- allows management and marketing to do their jobs
- assist in process improvement

Risk-based Test planning
Importance
- reduce risk 
- determine the risk (main goal)

Associated Definitions
- Risk: potential loss
- Components of risks: impact/loss and likelihood/protability
- Risk analysis: determining the impact and likelihood of risks
- Risk equation: risk=impact*likelihood
- Risk appetite: amount of loss than management is willing to accept 
- Risk mitigation: reducing risk

Nature of risk
- impact
    -- depth
        --severity of damage
        --availability of likelihood

    -- breadth
        --number (of systems/people) affected
        --cost of damage done

    Categories of impact
    - financial
    - reputation
    - licenses
    - cx/user base
    - employees
    - lives

- likelihood
    - possible factors for likelihood of filure
        -- size of module
        -- use of new (unproven) technology
        -- prior error history
        -- lack of skill or experience
        -- lack of motivation
        -- inadequate proceses.
        -- complex features or module
        -- new modules
        -- features transferred between devs
        -- untested code.
        -- features using large or distributed dev teams

Rik mitigation
- risk avoidance
- risk transfer
- risk management
    -- loss prevention
    -- crisis management
    -- training
