---Structural Testing---: one form of white box testing
- Black Box Vs White Box: 
    - Black box: focus primarily on ensuring that software behaves as we want or expected without having a knowledge of the code internal structure. 
    - White box: does take into account the structure of the code. code review, inspection, peer programming can all be considered white-box testing.

--Code Coverage Standards--
- Statement - requires that every line of code be executed at least once.
- condition 
- decision 
- branch
condition/decision
modified condition/decision
observable modified condition/decision

---Mutation Testing--- 
is one approach we can use to measure the adequacy of a certain test.
