---Test Doubles (input)---

1. Dummy Objects - fill-in objects required by the system under test (SUT) that are otherwise irrelevant for the test.

2. Test Stubs - provides dummy input data sources used by the SUT

3. Fake Objects - lightweight implementations of heavyweight processes like db.

4. Mock Objects - check indirect results produced by SUT -- somewhat Spy Objects

So in summary, #1-#3 provides test inputs, while #4 monitors test ouputs
