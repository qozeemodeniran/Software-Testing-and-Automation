---The V-model of Software Development---
Requirement - what the system is intended to do
Validation - making sure the system does what's intended
Specification - what system would do to meet requirements
Verification - confirmation that system performs and conforms to its specification
Architecture - includes decision whether or not to buy the product (should we build or buy?)
System int testing - evaluates how various components of the system are gonna work together.
Design - organising the modules and class desgins to work on.
Module Testing - how we test design module func befoe including in the larger components or subsystems
Implementation - actual coding of the solution.
Unit test - 

---Validation and Verification in the V-model---
 Validation - all about users perspective
 Verification - meeting some standards
